# Domoboard

Domoboard is a dashboard for Domoticz based on Python Flask. The decision was made to use Domoticz as an backend because it is a powerful framework for home automation. Flask was choosen to get all the powerful features that Python offers.

# Quick start

Clone the git:

```
cd /home/pi
git clone https://github.com/wez3/domoboard
```

Install virtualenv:

```
sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
```

Create the virtualenv:

```
virtualenv /home/pi/domoboard/
```

Start the virtualenv:

```
cd /home/pi/domoboard/
source bin/activate
```

Install Domoboard dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Modify the config file to suit your needs. Start Domoboard by executing:

```
python server.py -c <config_file>
```

It is possible to run Domoboard in "debug" mode by running the command:
```
python server.py -c <config_file> -d
```

To reactivate the virtualenv later on repeat the "Start the virtualenv" step.

# API

Domoboard has an API which can be found at "/api". All JavaScript files that update data frequently are using this API to obtain the information that is going to be displayed. By default all requests to the API are passed to the Domoticz backend. This means that Domoboard accepts the same API calls as Domoticz does.  However the API also allows an plugin developer to add its own API functions by creating an Python module. Developers can specify a "custom" GET-parameter which is patched in to the current API, this allows the developer to run their own Python functions when the API is called.

# Modulair

Domoboard is a framework which allows users to build custom plugins pretty easy. Plugins require the following at least:
- A HTML file in the templates/ folder (see templates/hello.html as an example)

For advanced features, such as custom API functions a developer needs to develop:
- A Python file in the plugins/ folder (see plugins/hello.py as an example)

The following plugins have been developed by now:
- iCloud plugin
- Traffic plugin

# Contributing

Everybody can contribute to the project! For development purposes the "develop" branch is used. The "master" branch contains the stable version of Domoboard.

Please let us know when you've created a plugin, so we can can add to the plugin Github repository.

# Special thanks

Special thanks to https://github.com/squandor for developing and testing on Domoboard before it was made public.
